Graphs are forms of communication:

- **Analysis**: describing data, detecting patterns and trends (default settings often give reasonable results)
- **Communication**: illustrating a conclusion (should be directly readable and often require changing graph titles, axis, labels, colors, symbols, adding legends, ...)

One of the main advantages of R is its strong graphic capabilities!

# Standard graphs

* Standard graphs in the `base` system are created by calling successive R functions to "build up" a graph in two stages:

1. **Creating** of a (customized) plot
2. **Annotating** of a plot (adding lines, points, text, legends)

**Example**: Cereals

```{r}
cereals <- read.csv("cereal.csv")  # read-in the cereals data set
```

E.g.: scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, barplots, piecharts...

```{r}
hist(cereals$rating)    # Histogramm of ratings
```
```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals)  # Scatterplot of calories against rating
```
```{r}
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals)    # Boxplot of rating vs. manufacturer
```

## Customizing standard graphs

Controlling (global) graphic parameters: colors, point symbols, line styles, labels and titles.

### Histogramm

 * changing bar colors and the title
 
```{r}
hist(cereals$rating, col="gray", main = "Histogramm of cerals ratings")
```

* changing x axis labels

```{r}
hist(cereals$rating, col="gray", main = "Histogramm of cerals ratings", xlab = "Rating")
```

* changing y axis scale

```{r}
hist(cereals$rating, col="gray", main = "Histogramm of cerals ratings", xlab = "Rating", freq = FALSE)
```

### Scatterplot

* changing plotting symbol color

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals)
```

* changing the title

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, main = "Scatterplot of cereals")
```

* changing the x and y range (limits: from = ?, to = ?)

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,200))
```

* changing the plotting symbol size

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,200), cex = 2)
```

* changing the plotting symbol (plotting character)

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim=c(0,100), ylim=c(0,200), cex = 2, pch = 19)
```

### Boxplot

* changing the box color

```{r}
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col = "gray")
```

* changing the box colors

```{r}
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col = c("gray","dodgerblue"))
```

* changing the tick labels (A: American Home Food Products; G: General Mills; K: Kelloggs; N: Nabisco; P: Post; Q: Quaker Oats; R: Ralston Purina)

```{r}
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col = c("gray","dodgerblue"), names = c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"))
```

### Colors in R

* Built-in 657 named colors:

```{r}
colors()
```

* R uses **hexadecimal** (a base-16 number system) to represent colors (hex model also translates to RGB, HSV, HCL color models), see also:

## Annotating an existing standard graph

* Adding text to a scatterplot

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, col="gray", main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,200), cex=2, pch = 19)
text(cereals$rating, cereals$calories, labels=cereals$name)
```

* Adding fitted lines to a scatterplot

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, col = "gray", main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,200), cex = 2, pch = 19)
abline(lm(calories ~ rating, data = cereals))
```

* Adding text to the fitted line in a scatterplot

```{r}
plot(calories ~ rating, data = cereals, col="gray", main = "Scatterplot of cereals", xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,200), cex = 2, pch=19)
mod <- lm(calories ~ rating, data = cereals)
abline(coef(mod))
text(20,150,paste("y =",round(coef(mod)[1],2),"beta_0 +",round(coef(mod)[2],2),"beta_1"))
```

* Adding data points the boxplot of rating vs. manufacturer

```{r}
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col = rainbow(7), names = c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"))
points(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, pch = 19)
```

* Adding a legend to the boxplot of rating vs. manufacturer

```{r}
legend("topleft", legend=c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"), bty="n", fill=rainbow(7))
```

### Further annotatins

The function `par()` can be used to specify the global graphics parameters that affect **all** plots in the active R session.

* Label text perpendicular to axis

```{r}
par(las=2) 
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col=rainbow(7), names = c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"))
legend("topleft", legend=c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"), bty="n", fill=rainbow(7))
```

* Increase the top margin (as no title is provided)

```{r}
par(las=2, mar=c(5,4,1,2))
boxplot(rating ~ mfr, data = cereals, col=rainbow(7), names = c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"))
legend("topleft", legend=c("A.H.F.P.","Mills","Kellogs","Nabisco","Post","Quaker", "Purina"), bty="n", fill=rainbow(7))
```

# The Grammer of Graphics

* Grammar to describe and construct statistical graphics; based on the idea of building up a graphic by semantic components.

* `ggplot2` is an R library that allows to build graphical features up in a series of layers:
 1. **aesthetic** mapping of the data (`aes()`), defines how variables are connected to visual properties or outputs (e.g. color, size, shape)
 2. **geometric** objects representing the data
 
 ---------------------------------
`geom_histogram()` | Histogramm
`geom_density()`   | Densityplot
`geom_area()`      | Areaplot
`geom_bar()`       | Barplot
`geom_point()`     | Points
`geom_lines()`     | Lines
`geom_boxplot()`   | Boxplot
`geom_violin()`    | Violinplot

 3. **coordinate systems** 
 `coord_flip()`
 
 4. **faceting** the data (splitting by some predefined criteria to display sup-graphs) 
 
 `facet_wrap()`
 `facet_grid()`
 
 5. **themes** to control non-data elements
 `theme_bw()` white background with grid lines
 `theme_grey()` grey background (default)
 `theme_classic()` white background (no grid lines)
 `theme_minimal()` minimal theme
 
```
ggplot(data = <DATA>,
       mapping = aes(<MAPPING>)) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```


scales (`scale_colour_brewer()`)



### Boxplot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

* Supply the `cereal` dataset and aesthetic mapping with `aes()` to the function call `ggplot()`

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cereals, aes(x=mfr, y=rating)) + 
   geom_boxplot()        # Box plot of rating vs. manufacturer
p
```

```{r}
p + coord_flip()         # Horizontal boxes (rotating the boxes)
```

```{r}
p + geom_jitter(shape = 16, position = position_jitter(0.1)) # Add jittered data points (0.1 : degree of jitter in x direction)
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cereals, aes(x=mfr, y=rating)) + 
    geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "red", outlier.shape = 8, outlier.size = 4) # Change outlier (color, shape and size)
p
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cereals, aes(x=mfr, y=rating, color=mfr)) +   # Change box plot line colors by groups
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Boxplot of cereals",x = "Manufacturer", y = "Rating")  
p
```

```{r}
p + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")  # Change box plot line colors by groups using brewer color palettes
```

```{r}
p + scale_color_grey() + theme_classic() # Change box plot line colors by groups using grey scale
```
